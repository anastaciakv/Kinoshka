Kinoshka is an Android app that diplays a list of movies using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

In order to built the source code and perform requests to the API you will need an [API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). Pease create a string resource with a name **the_movie_db_api_key** and set the value to your key.

`<string name="the_movie_db_api_key">INSERT YOUR API KEY</string>`
