Kinoshka is an Android app that displays a list of popular or top rated movies using [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

In order to built the source code and perform requests to the API you will need an [API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). 
In the project add your key to the **gradle.properties** like this:

`API_KEY=your_api_key_value`

The project is implemented using MVVM and DataBinding with Activities.
